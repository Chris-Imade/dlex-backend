## Introduction

Welcome to the Dlex project, an open-source initiative aimed at creating a versatile application for managing the affairs of small to medium-sized organizations. Dlex is designed to reduce fraud within an organization and create a secure and efficient system for managing various aspects, from products to transactions and more.

## Technologies Used

Dlex is built using a stack of modern technologies:

- **Electron:** For the multi-platform desktop application frontend.
- **Node.js:** For the backend server.
- **Express:** As the web application framework.
- **MongoDB:** As the database system.

## Key Features

### Offline and Auto-Syncing

One of Dlex's standout features is its ability to work seamlessly both online and offline. When connected to the internet, data is automatically synchronized with the central server. Users can continue working even when offline, and once they're back online, Dlex automatically syncs their changes, ensuring data integrity and accessibility at all times.

### Automated Reports in Excel Format

Dlex simplifies reporting by generating automated reports in Excel (.xls) format. These reports are sent directly to the user's email, making it easy to access and share critical information. Whether it's transaction summaries, product catalogs, or financial statements, Dlex streamlines the reporting process, saving time and effort for users.

--- **Routes**

--- **Products Routes**

- It is worth noting that most endpoints requires the userId to be passed on as a query to the path, it's also worth noting that each request except the authentication requests are to have an Authoriazation header with the value of type {{Token actual_token}}

- **Post: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/reports/sendTransaction?userId={{userId}}`**
**This endpoint would fetch all the transactions belonging to the current user and convert the data to a CSV file after which the file is sent the the user's registered mail.**

- **Post: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/products?userId={{userId}}`**
**This endpoint creates a new product from the JSON body passed on to the req object. It also returns the new product created.**

- **Get: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/products?userId={{userId}}`**
- **This endpoint returns all the products the user has created it take's no parameter or parses no body.**

- **Get: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/products/{{productId}}?userId={{userId}}` This endpoint returns the single product of which its id is being passed on as a parameter in the path.**

- **Put: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/products/{{productId}}?userId={{userId}}` This endpoint updates the product of which it's id is passed as a parameter, it takes in the update as a json object and returns the updated product.**

- **Delete: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/products/{{productId}}?userId={{userId}}` This endpoints does a series of things. When a product is deleted, the email of the user extracted from the user's token in the Authorization and then used alongside nodemailer and some other transparent factors to update the user/admin/owner the certain products have been deleted.**

- **It is also worth noting that images used for the products are stored as base64 strings and when the user makes a delete requests, the images are uploaded to cloudinary from where the preview images are used as thumbnails for the mail.**

--- **Transaction Routes**


- **Post: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/transaction?userId={{userId}}`**
**This endpoint creates a new transaction from the JSON body passed on to the req object. It also returns the new transaction created.**

- **Get: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/transaction?userId={{userId}}`**
- **This endpoint returns all the transaction the user has created it take's no parameter or parses no body.**

- **Get: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/transaction/{{transactionId}}?userId={{userId}}` This endpoint returns the single transaction of which its id is being passed on as a parameter in the path.**

- **Put: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/transaction/{{transactionId}}?userId={{userId}}` This endpoint updates the transaction of which it's id is passed as a parameter, it takes in the update as a json object and returns the updated transaction.**

- **Delete: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/transaction/{{transactionId}}?userId={{userId}}` This simply filters out the transaction based on the id passed and then deletes it.**


- **For the users route:**
- **Get: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/users/user-id:`**
**This route uses the Authorization header to get the user's id and send back as a response, can come in handy when you need to know the user's id in other to make other requests.**

- **Put: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/users/user/{{userId}}` **chatgpt - only - you should know how to describe this by now save me the time**

- **Get: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/users/user/{{userId}}`:**
**Gets a single user by user ID.**

**For Authentication:**
**Post: `{{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/auth/register`**
--- **This route takes some basic information about the user in this format:**
```javascript
{
	"email": string,
	"username": string,
	"password": string,
	"isAdmin": boolean
}
```

**it returns:**
```javascript
{
	"message": "Success",
	"status": 201,
	"detail": "User successfully created"
} 
```
--- **when successful and an error when not. Errors may vary depending on the kind of issues to be addressed.**

- **Post: {{ _.baseURL }}/api/v1/auth/login**
--- **This endpoint expects as minimal as:**
```javascript
{
	"username": string,
	"password": string
}
```

--- **and returns and example response:**
```javascript
{
	"message": "Success",
	"status": 200,
	"details": "User successfully logged in ðŸ˜‡",
	"token": "**chatgpt - only - jwt token sample here**"
}
```

--- **when everything works fine. And a corresponding error when things goes sideways.**
